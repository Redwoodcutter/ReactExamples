            <p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.
                 Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. The least little bit can do so much. This is your world. I guess I'm a little weird. 
                I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.
            </p>
            <p>
            In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Learn when to stop. Use what you see, don't plan it.
            </p>
            <p>
            That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. 
            Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.
             Just let these leaves jump off the brush Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. All you have to do is let your imagination 
             go wild.
